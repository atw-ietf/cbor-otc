<t>This document standardizes a method to compress groupings of CBOR ordinal types such as integers and floats. The concept is then applied to the specific case of using integers as keys in CBOR maps that can be used by protocol specifications to enable re-use of the most concise CBOR encodings. Such compression to enable these encodings are desirable in highly constrained environments.</t>

        <name>Purpose</name>
        <t>Many applications may require very compact encodings on the wire to exchange data. CBOR enables such compact encodings and with specific techniques can be further compressed.</t>
        <t>and with Major Type 5, herein referred to as a "map", enables flexible data models that remain compact by using integers as keys.</t>
        <t>Existing practice is to define registries of integer values to be used a keys in CBOR that sometimes, depending on the use, also have a mapping to a JSON key. These registries however are implicitly context based with no real encoding on wire to indicate what set of values to use without being in the know.</t>
        <t>A way to enable CBOR maps to explicitly indicate their "context", while also enabling compact encodings of keys, could be valuable for some applications.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="background">
        <name>Background</name>
        <t>The most compact key form is the encoding in CBOR is <tt>1+0</tt> where the integer value (positive; Major Type 0 or negative; Major Type 1) is contained in the lower 5-bits of the CBOR byte and is limited to the range of -24 to 23. Usually this range in a registry is reserved to the strongest of registration policies to ensure use is not abused and fair.</t>
        <t>This can result in a proliferation of registries, that applications create in their own namespaces, to gain access to the restricted or already allocated values in this desirable range. This can cause interoperability issues when an application fails to, or improperly references, the wrong registry of values for a data structure such as a map.</t>
        <section anchor="inspiration">
          <name>Inspiration</name>
          <t>The proposed solution for the above problem is inspired by a number of previous technologies and concepts: Motorola 6800 addressing modes, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), VPI (Virtual Path Identifier), and VCI (Virtual Channel Identifier).</t>
          <t>There are two ways to describe the solution: block floating point but for integers indexing things or CBORing CBOR map keys.</t>

      <name>Ordinal Context Compression</name>
      <t>A group of ordinal values, such as an array of integers or floats, can be compressed in CBOR with a locality of reference by applying a technique similar to block floating point. This has an advantage of dereferencing the larger, typically common, portion of a group values once (called an "context, "block" or "base") leaving the individual elements to be smaller deviations (called "offsets") from that reference.</t>
      <t>For a oversimplified example the numbers <tt>1.6324</tt>, <tt>1.0432</tt> and <tt>1.7162</tt> all share a base of <tt>1.0</tt> enabling the values to be encoded as their offsets of <tt>0.6324</tt>, <tt>0.0432</tt> and <tt>0.7162</tt> with a transmitted base of <tt>1</tt> used by decoders to re-expand to the original values.</t>
      <t>This document standardizes a new CBOR Tag (<tt>#6.TBD(array)</tt>) called "Ordinal Group Compression" (OGC) to indicate such a compression occurring for the given ordinal types within a structure (i.e. array or map) that includes this tag against any ordinal type (<tt>int</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, etc.). The contents of the tag are defined in <xref target="tag-ogc"/>.</t>
      <figure anchor="tag-ogc">
        <name>Ordinal Group Compression Tag CDDL</name>
        <sourcecode type="ascii-text"><![CDATA[
#6.TBD = [
  ? uint_base: uint,
  ? nint_base: nint,
  ? bstr_base: [prefix: bstr / null, suffix: bstr / null],
  ? tstr_base: [prefix: tstr / null, suffix: tstr / null],
  ? float_base: float,
]
]]></sourcecode>
      </figure>
      <t>The tag MUST be either the first element in an array or a defined key in map. When structures are nested the local nested scope OGC tag, if present, takes precedence over any parent scope OGC tag . This applies to the individual ordinal types in the tag not the whole tag itself. So individual types can be re-scoped without losing the others from the parent scope.</t>
      <t>For example an array with the previous values as example would be tagged for encoding in CBOR as follows:</t>
      <sourcecode type="ascii-text"><![CDATA[
tagged = [
  #6.TBD([1.0]),

      <name>Using OGC for Keys in CBOR Maps</name>
      <t>Keys in CBOR maps can be either integers (<tt>int</tt>) or strings (<tt>tstr</tt>). For most specifications interested in the concise encoding of CBOR integers, the mapping to JSON is relegated to registrations in a IANA registry requesting both a number and string for registration (see <xref target="json-names"/>). Since the keys in a map can be integers the concept of OGC can be used in a more specific case to compress the keys in a map. This method is called "Application Specific Dynamically Assigned" or ASDA.</t>
      <t>This document assumes a specification will create a registry that uses the full CBOR integer range of <tt>-2^64^</tt> to <tt>2^64^-1</tt>. <xref target="asdak-ranges"/> defines a standard Label registry policy for protocol standards to use with large ecosystems expecting multiple applications with potentially shared key sets to be used in maps.</t>
      <t>Two special ranges are defined to support smaller encodings of keys: Application Specific Dynamically Assigned Keys (ASDAK) and eXtended Application Specific Dynamically Assigned Keys (XASDAK). A special reservation is made for the Application Specific Context (ASC).</t>

      <t>To should be noted that the subdivision of the range between <tt>24</tt> and <tt>2^64^-1</tt> is a recommendation. A protocol standard may adjust this section of the range to fit their specific requirements. For example instead of any subdivision this part of the Label range can all be First Come First Served.</t>
      <t>A map under a protocol using this specification MUST always include Label 0 with a value as defined in <xref target="asc"/> to keep the property of "self-describing" in CBOR intact and provide local context to the current scope for the keys. Failure to do so can result in undefined behavior on decoders such as failing to perform a clean context switch. A map MAY use keys outside its context at any point by using that keys registered Label.</t>

        <name>Supporting JSON</name>
        <t>A specification can support JSON for keys in the registry by requiring that a Name is provided for each registration, besides the Indirect ASCs, to use in JSON encodings. The Name MUST be a valid JSON key string as defined in <xref target="STD90"/>. One should ensure that the length of the Name is not overly long to maintain some level of small encoding, but is subject the specific registry rules by the specification. For Label 0 the Name MUST be set to <tt>asc</tt> - though is unused.</t>
        <t>For ASDAK in a JSON, the concept of a "context" is rather pointless as the keys in the registry would each have a unique Name registered to use in the JSON encoding. One could have a "context" by specifying a prefix string to add to the keys but this would add overhead in encoding for no real benefit. Such behavior is NOT RECOMMENDED.</t>

              <t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values in these fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</t>
              <t>To make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.</t>
